## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- Framer Motion

### What I learned

It was very hard to make it work nicely with mobile. In this way, I learned a lot about making my code work well in both mobile and desktop by always checking the changes for mobile.

### Continued development

I would add Spock and Lizard.
